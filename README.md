# 30-Days-Of-Python-Restart

Following [Asabeneh's curriculum](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-Python) to revive my python coding skills from 2 years ago. This repository contains as many solutions to his course as I could solve. There are some solutions which are unavailble due to factors I can't control.

## Incomplete Days

- Day 15
  - The exercises state to simply retry already given code.
- Day 23
  - Simply follow the code given in the markdown.
- Day 26
  - Solution in the [python_flask](https://github.com/saintwithataint/30-Days-Of-Python-Restart/tree/main/python_flask) folder.
- Day 27
  - No exercises given, I'd recommend to just re-attemp the code given in the markdown.
- Day 28
  - Reading Exercise, No output to show.
- Day 29
  - The API link shown in the exercise isn't working anymore. Nothing to build the exercise off of.
- Day 30
  - Congrats.
